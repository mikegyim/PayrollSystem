# Payroll-Systm


-The payroll system project is private on my github because it was for academic work 
since my professor said he might give the same project to subseqquent class
-WILLING TO GRANT ACCESS TO RECRUITERS WHENEVER IT IS REQUESTED

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-I used boost liibrary, cmake, qt and clion to design this software
-I implemented all invariants and made sure all constructors and member functions have
appropriate precondtions and postconditions and asserted the invariant at appropriate times
-I used CMake and QTest to add data-driven tests to the payroll system. 

-All the files for the development processes are hourlyemployee.cpp, hourlyemployee.h, salariedemployee.cpp, 
salariedemployee.h, employee.h, employee.cpp, ssn.h, ssn.cpp, main.cpp, employeetest.cpp, hourlyemployeetest.cpp,
salariedemployeetest.cpp, snntest.cpp, cmakelist.txt, cmakelocal.txt, assertexcept.cpp, assertexcept.h
